# MaaS Global Reference Schemas

This repository contains definitions and examples for the JSON Schema format used by MaaS Global.
The format is currently a subset of `http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#` and
`https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/vocab/hyper-schema`.

The way we describe tuples seem to be from some earlier version of the specification.

Also, our schemas contain a custom keyword `invalid` with negative test cases.
